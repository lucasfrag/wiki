<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üìö About The Project
**The year is 2016.** I was starting my second semester at college and I was very excited about the moment I was living. I was studying technology, I was very interested in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcybersecurity and hacking, I had gotten my first job in the area as a support person at a web hosting company where I learned a lot about how the Internet actually works. Entertainment media was getting me even more excited: we had the **Mr. Robot** series and the **Ex-Machina** movie, **Watch_Dogs 2** was coming out at the end of the year and **Deus Ex: Mankind Divided** had me wondering, *"Could technology take us to new heights in the coming months?"* ü§Ø

As *Adam Jensen* says in the [Deus Ex: Human Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc&ab_channel=IGN): **"It is a time of great innovation and technological advancement." üí¨**

I was very excited and I was studying a lot! I studied and practiced every day, and in the process I was saving my projects, tutorials, articles, documentation, videos and many other artifacts in random folders on my computer. It was a lot of stuff! And the lack of organization was starting to bother me.

When I had a big project to develop in college to apply everything I had learned about web development, and according to the teacher we could choose whatever theme we wanted, I saw an opportunity to mix everything that excited me in entertainment media for the front-end (like the [Dedsec Fankit](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/13qrfvKY8TBLMHHDSe2zdh/watch-dogs-2-grab-the-dedsec-fankit-and-marcus-holloway-cosplay-guide) materials made available by *Ubisoft* to promote the game **Watch_Dogs 2**) and at the same time solve my organization problem with a Wiki that would centralize all this knowledge base that I had gathered at the time.

Despite all the enthusiasm, I was still very inexperienced. I did a cool project and got a good grade in college. After that, I saved the project on my GitHub and never touched it again.

Now, in 2025, I revisited that project and, although it is not the best project I have ever done, it brought back many good memories. So I decided to bring it to GitHub and make it public to make up my portfolio. 


### ‚ö†Ô∏è ATEN√á√ÉO!!! 
**This project was developed as part of an educational activity and is for educational purposes only.** 

The project has several technical problems. At the time, I was still using *myqsl_connect()* because that was the function we used in PHP 5 to connect to the MySQL database.
Besides, everything is a mess! Reorganizing this project would take a lot of time and even then it wouldn't solve the many structural problems it has. **It is not recommended for use in production environments.**

A message to my step-self:

üí¨ "Don't worry, little Lucas. You did a good job. But now let's do a better job! **Let's rebuild the Wiki!**"

### ...The Solution! üòç

A Wiki for organizing and reading files through the browser.
And I will be very transparent. In this repository you will find the old version of the project and the new one too, so you can see the evolution we have made.

I won't be making any radical changes. The idea is to redo the project based on the same principles and feelings I had in the past. This means that I will keep the same visual identity, with small polishes - even if my experience disagrees with some things.

The system should be simple, without many technological complexities. 

The technologies would be limited to HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and just PHP on the back-end to meet some needs. This way, the project would easily run on any computer with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html) or even [USBWebServer](https://usbwebserver.yura.mk.ua/).
And, as long as the PC is turned on, it can also be accessed on the local network by other devices such as a smartphone or tablet.

<b>NO DATABASE!</b> Instead, PHP will access a directory, read the folders, subfolders, and files, and create an interface based on them. This way, the user (me) would only worry about organizing the files within the directory instead of doing CRUDs for each new file.

This is a personal project created for me. This is not a product, it's not a solution, it's not a service. This is a rescue of memories of the old me and a message to remind myself: you did it!
